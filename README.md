Developing the OnApp Go
-----------------------

If you wish to work on the OnApp Go, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.15.x is *required*).
You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.
