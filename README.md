Developing the OnApp Go SDK
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the OnApp Go SDK, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.11.4+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

For guidance on common development practices such as testing changes or vendoring libraries, see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/onapp/onapp-sdk-go/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md). If you have other development questions we don't cover, please file an issue!
